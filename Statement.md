## 📌Problem Statement

Most of the time, managing a chronic condition or tracking temporary illnesses relies on human memory, which is subjective and prone to errors.
Patients are frequently unable to answer quite specific, data-driven questions requested by healthcare providers,
such as "How long after taking the medication did the pain subside?" or "What specific triggers precede your migraines?"
Without accurate and longitudinal data, treatment plans are less effective, and often critically important correlations between lifestyle habits,
medication intake, and symptom severity are missed.

## 📌Scope of the Project
This project aims at developing an intelligent health tracking application that goes beyond static logging towards analytical insights.

### Functional Scope: 
The system will enable the user to record unique health events (medications and symptoms) with automatic timestamping. 
Then, it will store this information persistently and carry out simple statistical functions to identify trends.

### Technical Scope: 
Solution will be implemented in Python; data manipulation will be done using the Pandas library, while finding the correlation will be done using Scikit-learn. 
The first interface will be a CLI interface, which later can be upgraded to GUI or Web Application.

### Analytical Scope: 
The project includes basic concepts of Machine Learning, such as regression or correlation analysis, to identify relations between inputs (medication) and outputs (symptom relief).

* Limitations include the fact that the system provides informational analytics alone and does not provide medical diagnoses. Complex NLP is considered a future enhancement.
  
## 📌Target Users
* Chronic Patients: People with chronic ailments such as migraine, arthritis, and allergic reactions that require monitoring of triggers and alleviation.

* Caregivers: Family members monitoring health data for elderly or pediatric patients, ensuring adherence to medications.

* Self-Quantifiers: Health-conscious individuals trying to evaluate the effectiveness of new medication regimens or lifestyle changes.
  
## 📌High-level Features
* Smart Event Logging: An interface that allows efficiently recording medication dosages and symptom occurrences, reducing friction to a minimum.

* Automatic Temporal Tracking: accurate timestamping of each entry to show duration between intake of medication and alleviation of symptom.

* Data Persistence: Robust storage of health history in structured formats that allow for long-term trend analysis.

* AI/ML-Pattern Recognition: Statistical analysis algorithms that identify relationships between certain medications and the reduction of symptoms.

* Health Analytics Dashboard: A view that gives the user a summary of the frequency count, recent activity logs, and actionable insights extracted from their data.
